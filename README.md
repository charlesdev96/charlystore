🛒 Multi-Vendor Marketplace API (NestJS)
I'm excited to share a backend project I just completed using NestJS!
It’s a multi-vendor marketplace API, similar to platforms like Amazon or Jumia — built to showcase my skills in backend development.

🔧 Core Features:
🔐 JWT Authentication with role-based access (Vendor & Customer)

🛍️ Product listing and store management for vendors

🛒 Cart system and order creation for customers

🔎 Search and filtering of products

📦 Clean architecture using modules, services, DTOs, guards, and global exception filters

⚠️ I intentionally left out payments and admin functionality for now, focusing instead on API design, scalability, and best practices.

💡 Why I Built It
I wanted a challenging, real-world project to apply everything I’ve learned with NestJS and show my understanding of:

a. Modular architecture

b. API versioning & error handling

c. Entity relationships and database modeling

Building scalable and maintainable services

🚀 What's Next?
I'm looking to:

1. Add a basic admin panel later

2. Possibly integrate with Stripe/Paystack when appropriate
